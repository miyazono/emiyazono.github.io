- I hate that we intentionally remove structural information when converting an outline to straight prose, so here you'll mostly get outlines
  - Consider them to be the “stock cubes of my writing” 
  - I especially feel no need to add transitions when you can just throw this into chatGPT and get it with all the texture, meter, and rhymes you want
    - no, please don't send me your best examples.  If they're particularly good, you can tweet them at me.
- 
- I’ll try to keep things as concise as possible, but you still might have questions - that’s what comments are for (might have to change this later, but that feels like failing upwards)
- 
- Obviously, these opinions are my own.  Nothing here is advice (legal, financial, or otherwise), even (especially) if it looks like it.
