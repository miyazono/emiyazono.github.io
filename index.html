I currently lead Atlas Computing, a nonprofit demonstrating how to achieve human review of advanced AI.

I previously led Network Goods, a venture studio within Protocol Labs. Before that, I built and led the company's research grants program and built a small team deploying new mechanisms to accelerate science (aka metascience entreprenuership).
