# My current & recent interests:
- reducing AI risk by making AI prove its outputs certain properties
  - this is what I spend most of my time on at [Atlas Computing](https://atlascomputing.org/)
- "revolutionary coordination systems"
  - This was the focus of Network Goods, the venture studio I ran at Protocol Labs
  - We thought about the overlap of mechanism design, social choice theory, and metascience

# Prior work at Protocol Labs
### What was Network Goods:
- I created and led a team ranging between 10 and 25 people (including contractors) with a budget of up to ~$7M/yr
- We started and spun out
    - [hypercerts](https://hypercerts.org/)
    - [Funding the Commons](https://fundingthecommons.io/)(conference series)
    - [The Open Impact Foundation](https://openimpact.foundation/)
    - [gov4git](https://gov4git.org/)
    - [Open Source Observer](https://www.opensource.observer/)
- We accelerated [Discourse Graphs](https://discoursegraphs.ai/)
- We supported davidad during the initial proposal of the [Open Agency Architecture](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pKSmEkSQJsCSTK6nH/an-open-agency-architecture-for-safe-transformative-ai)

### What was PL Research:
I started the long-term research and metascience arm of Protocol Labs, which included 
  - the [PL Research RFP program](https://protocol.ai/blog/ann-research-rfp/), advancing the cutting edge of networking, distributed systems, and cryptography research with $5M in grants to academic researchers.
  - a team of independent researcher nicknamed [the AbstractionLab](https://grants.protocol.ai/groups/abstractionlab/)
  - support for Nadia Eghbal's research and creation of [Working in Public](https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public)

# Education
- In 2017, I completed my PhD at Caltech as Andrei Faraon's first grad student, where I was working on a scalable optical quantum memory ([thesis](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/10096/)).
- My formative college years included a BS and MS in Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford, lots of courses in math, CS, and philosophy, and perhaps a surprising amount of set design and construction.

### Published writings
- See my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3JFKiuAAAAAJ) for a fairly comprehensive list of my academic writings.
- I also frequently reference [this blogpost](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2020/sourcecred-an-introduction-to-calculating-cred-and-grain/) I wrote about [the SourceCred project](https://sourcecred.io/)'s method of providing algorithmic impact measurment of open source software in an effort to create permissionless employment.
- I think [this blogpost](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2023/discourse-graphs-and-the-future-of-science/) is still a pretty comprehensive summary of why we need Discourse Graphs as a micropublication standard for immediately and continuously open science.
- And I feel like [this list of questions](https://quantumfrontiers.com/2014/05/25/top-10-questions-for-your-potential-phd-advisergroup/) (for new grad students picking a group) have stood up pretty well since I was a grad student.

 
### Little things
Real-world backlinks from people or insitutions I deeply respect (roughly chronologically)
- I've gotten multiple shout-outs from 3blue1brown (am I a hand model?)
- I've been thanked in multiple pieces by Michael Nielsen
- Vitalik has publicly name-checked two projects started on my team (hypercerts and Open Agency Architecture)
- I've organized [a metascience workshop](https://www.santafe.edu/events/accelerating-science-risks-incentives-and-rewards) at the Santa Fe Institute
- Andrew Critch and davidad jointly suggested I start what is now Atlas Computing


### Contact
If you want to talk about something related to Atlas Computing, use [the contact link](https://forms.gle/QApy1MRqqfNcprag6) or [email](mailto:hello@atlascomputing.org) on the atlas website (I'm on the other end of it).

If you want to talk about something NOT related to my current job, email me at \[first name\].\[second half of last name\]@gmail.com but note that it might take me a while to respond.

I'm also probably more responsive to LinkedIn messages and twitter DMs than email thanks to [beeper](http://beeper.com/), but I tend not to accept LinkedIn connections that don't have a message unless we've met.
